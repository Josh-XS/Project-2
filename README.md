# Wine Rating
## How different features affect the rating of wine

**Joshua Nickell**:

### Business Problem:

I am going to try to create a model to predict the rating a wine will recieve.

### Data:
The data can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/spanish-wine-quality-dataset

## Models
I created a logistic regression model, and a KNeighbors model. Both had an overall accuracy around 40%. I ended up using the KNeighbors model because it had a slightly higher accuracy at 43%, which is still not great.

## Recommendations:
I would not recommend using this model for production. This dataset has alot of tweaking that needs to be done to the features to make the models better at predictions.
